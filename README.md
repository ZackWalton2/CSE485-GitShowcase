My name is Zack Walton and I am showcasing the skill of Git for Professionals. I will be doing a small program that adds users to a database for storage. It is replicating as if you were doing it for a school and holds the name, age, and year of the student with a random id. There are still more things you could add, but this is a proof of concept and a practice of git.

To run this, download the necessary dependencies with: npm install
Then use: node .

This will ask you in the terminal the questions for who you want to add.
